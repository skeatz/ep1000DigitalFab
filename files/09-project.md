## Final Project
* This is an individual capstone project that integrates the range of technologies covered in this module.
* Your project must meet the following requirements:
 * The project must include:
    * 2D & 3D designed parts
    * 3D printed part(s)
    * Laser cut part(s)
    * an embedded microntroller (e.g. arduino)
    * input and output devices that interacts with the user
    * embedded program
  * Your project must include
    * all original design & source code files
    * screen capture/photos showing stages in development as well as final product
  * System integration/packaging is an important aspect of a final project. All electronics should be neatly mounted and wiring neatly laid out and not simply just thrown together in the case

## Group Project
* You may combine with other students to do a larger, more challenging project
* Each member's portion of the group project must meet the individual project requirements listed above
* You must document the role/task of each member if it is a group project
* Each member of the group must document the overall project on your individual website, with emphasis on your individual contribution to the group project
  
## Project presentation
* Prepare a 1 page (1920 x 1080 pix) poster of your project, showing
  * overall project
  * technologies used
  * group members
* Prepare a 1 minute video (1920 x 1080) documenting your project development process and the final working  project

## Other information
* Complete your final project, tracking your progress:
  * what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 
  * what's working? what's not?
  * what questions need to be resolved?
  * what will happen when?
  * what have you learned?

## Reminder on Time Management
* Project management
  * triage
  * documentation during development
  * demand- vs supply-side time management
  * spiral development, DevOps
  * serial vs parallel tasks
  * system integration
  * finish quality
* Document as you work, do not wait to complete everything before you start your documentation
